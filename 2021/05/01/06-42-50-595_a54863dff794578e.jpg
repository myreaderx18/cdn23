Armstrong also denounced debates around &#8220;causes or political candidates&#8221; arguing that such discussions distracted from the company&#8217;s core work. About 60 members of Coinbase&#8217;s 1,200 person staff took buyouts in light of the internal policy change \u2014 a ratio that makes the exodus at Basecamp look even more dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>Like Coinbase, Basecamp was immediately criticized for muzzling its employees over important issues, many of which disproportionately impact marginalized employees.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing the line on &#8220;political&#8221; topics becomes murky very quickly for any non-white or LGBTQ employees, for whom many issues that might be seen as political in nature in some circles \u2014 the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance \u2014 are inextricably and deeply personal.

This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verifiedmarketresearch.com\/product\/global-analytics-as-a-service-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025\/\">Verified Market Research<\/a>, the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights. Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.<\/p>\n<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company&#8217;s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling \u2014 enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.<\/p>\n<p>AaaS could come bundled with multiple business-intelligence-related services. Primarily, the service includes (1) services for data warehouses; (2) services for visualizations and reports; and (3) services for predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). When a company partners with an MSP for analytics as a service, organizations are able to tap into business intelligence easily, instantly and at a lower cost of ownership than doing it in-house. This empowers the enterprise to focus on delivering better customer experiences, be unencumbered with decision-making and build data-driven strategies.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOrganizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world, where customers value experiences over transactions, AaaS helps businesses dig deeper into their psyche and tap insights to build long-term winning strategies.

sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Toponce, a systems administrator at XMission, received a letter on Thursday from a law firm representing What3Words, requesting that he delete tweets related to the open-source alternative, WhatFreeWords. The letter also demands that he disclose to the law firm the identity of the person or people with whom he had shared a copy of the software, agree that he would not make any further copies of the software and to delete any copies of the software he had in his possession.<\/p>\n<p>The letter gave him until May 7 to agree, after which What3Words would &#8220;waive any entitlement it may have to pursue related claims against you,&#8221; a thinly-veiled threat of legal action.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not a battle worth fighting,&#8221; he said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AaronToponce\/status\/1387933438305394690?s=20\">in a tweet<\/a>. Toponce told TechCrunch that he has complied with the demands, fearing legal repercussions if he didn&#8217;t. He has also asked the law firm twice for links to the tweets they want deleting but has not heard back. &#8220;Depending on the tweet, I may or may not comply.

In a later write-up, Tierney said What3Words was <a href=\"https:\/\/cybergibbons.com\/security-2\/why-what3words-is-not-suitable-for-safety-critical-applications\/\">not adequate<\/a> for use in safety-critical cases.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the only downside. Critics have <a href=\"https:\/\/shkspr.mobi\/blog\/2019\/03\/why-bother-with-what-three-words\/ \">long argued<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; proprietary geocoding technology, which it bills as &#8220;life-saving,&#8221; makes it harder to examine it for problems or security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6HwlbIsMT7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/\">Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/embed\/#?secret=6HwlbIsMT7\" data-secret=\"6HwlbIsMT7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Concerns about its lack of openness in part led to the creation of the WhatFreeWords. A copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/justpaste.it\/39hat\">the project&#8217;s website<\/a>, which does not contain the code itself, said the open-source alternative was developed by reverse-engineering What3Words. &#8220;Once we found out how it worked, we coded implementations for it for JavaScript and Go,&#8221; the website said. &#8220;To ensure that we did not violate the What3Words company&#8217;s copyright, we did not include any of their code, and we only included the bare minimum data required for interoperability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But the project&#8217;s website was nevertheless subjected to a <a href=\"https:\/\/ivan.sanchezortega.es\/w3w-bullying\/2019-09-19\/SCIP%20-%20Ecommerce%20Takedown%20Notice%20-%20W3W%2019%20Sept%202019.pdf\">copyright takedown request<\/a> filed by What3Words&#8217; counsel. Even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.owenboswarva.com\/misc\/W3W_Twitter_20191007.pdf\">tweets<\/a> that pointed to cached or backup copies of the code were removed by Twitter at the lawyers&#8217; requests.<\/p>\n<p>Toponce \u2014 a security researcher on the side \u2014 contributed to Tierney&#8217;s research, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1387164574294712321\">tweeting out<\/a> his findings as he went. Toponce said that he offered to share a copy of the WhatFreeWords code with other researchers to help Tierney with his ongoing research into What3Words. Toponce told TechCrunch that receiving the legal threat may have been a combination of offering to share the code and also finding problems with What3Words.<\/p>\n<p>In its letter to Toponce, What3Words argues that WhatFreeWords contains its intellectual property and that the company &#8220;cannot permit the dissemination&#8221; of the software.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, several websites still retain copies of the code and are easily searchable through Google, and TechCrunch has seen several tweets linking to the WhatFreeWords code since Toponce went public with the legal threat. Tierney, who did not use WhatFreeWords as part of his research, said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1388187147560161282\">in a tweet<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; reaction was &#8220;totally unreasonable given the ease with which you can find versions online.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We asked What3Words if the company could point to a case where a judicial court has asserted that WhatFreeWords has violated its copyright. What3Words spokesperson Miriam Frank did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZMXrNbYiy4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/\">Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/embed\/#?secret=ZMXrNbYiy4\" data-secret=\"ZMXrNbYiy4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A U.K. company behind digital addressing system What3Words has sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.

Here&#8217;s a clearer picture of the instance used at the beginning of this piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a VC-backed startup whose ultimate goal is to help scale up female-founded SMEs with one-year loans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The startup could <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easily<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use its equity to provide the capital for all the one-year loans.

incredible year. But one indicator points to longer-term changes. The internal rate of return (IRR) for companies in other startup hub cities has been even better. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/internal-rates-of-return-in-emerging-us-tech-hubs-are-starting-to-overtake-silicon-valley\/\">big new analysis by AngelList<\/a> showed aggregate IRR of 19.4% per year on syndicated deals elsewhere versus 17.5% locally. A separate measure, of total value of paid-in investment, revealed 1.67x returns for other hubs versus 1.60x in the main Silicon Valley and Bay Area tech cities.<\/p>\n<p>The data is based on a sample of 2,500 companies that have used AngelList to syndicate deals from 2013 through 2020. Which is just one snapshot, but a relevant one given how hard it can be to produce accurate early-stage startup market analysis at this scale. I believe we&#8217;ll see more and more data confirming the trends in the coming years, especially as more of the startup world acclimates to remote-first and distributed offices. You can increasingly do a startup from anywhere and make it a success. Not that Silicon Valley is lacking optimism, as you&#8217;ll see in a number of the other stories in the roundup below!<\/p>\n<p>Eric Eldon<br \/>\nManaging Editor, Extra Crunch<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>(Subbing in for Walter today as he&#8217;s enjoying a well-deserved break and <em>definitely not still checking the site<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<h2>Optimism reigns at consumer trading services as fintech VC spikes and Robinhood IPO looms<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1996010\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1996010\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1996010\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1996010\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nigelsussman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nigel Sussman <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>With the Coinbase direct listing behind us and the Robinhood IPO ahead, it\u2019s a heady time for consumer-focused trading apps.<\/p>\n<p>Mix in the impending SPAC-led debut of eToro, general bullishness in the cryptocurrency space, record highs for some equities markets, and recent rounds from Public.com, M1 Finance and U.K.-based Freetrade, and you could be excused for expecting the boom in consumer asset trading to keep going up and to the right.<\/p>\n<p>But will it?

Zego\u2019s $150 million round at unicorn valuation in March, a rumored giant incoming round for WeFox, and a slew of IPOs and SPACs in the U.S. are all testament to this.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not difficult to see why. The insurance market is enormous, but the sector has suffered from notoriously poor customer experience, and major incumbents have been slow to adapt. Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology. And the pandemic has cast the spotlight on high-potential categories, including health, mobility and cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p>This has begun to brew a perfect storm of conditions for big European insurtech exits.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Gj4W557dBq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/the-era-of-the-european-insurtech-ipo-will-soon-be-upon-us\/\">The era of the European insurtech IPO will soon be upon us<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The era of the European insurtech IPO will soon be upon us&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/the-era-of-the-european-insurtech-ipo-will-soon-be-upon-us\/embed\/#?secret=Gj4W557dBq\" data-secret=\"Gj4W557dBq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2145475\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2145475\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2145475\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg\" alt=\"Medicine doctor hand working with modern computer interface as medical network concept\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg 2121w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/GettyImages-1125001052.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2145475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/search\/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Busakorn+Pongparnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Busakorn Pongparnit <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a> \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The recent movement toward data transparency is bringing about a new era of innovation and startups.<\/p>\n<p>Those who follow the space closely may have noticed that there are twin struggles taking place: a push for more transparency on provider and payer data, including anonymous patient data, and another for strict privacy protection for personal patient data.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the main difference, and how can startups solve these problems?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bQaLK82Aww\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/30\/the-health-data-transparency-movement-is-birthing-a-new-generation-of-startups\/\">The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/30\/the-health-data-transparency-movement-is-birthing-a-new-generation-of-startups\/embed\/#?secret=bQaLK82Aww\" data-secret=\"bQaLK82Aww\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tech companies in Silicon Valley, the geography, have had an incredible year.

This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verifiedmarketresearch.com\/product\/global-analytics-as-a-service-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025\/\">Verified Market Research<\/a>, the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights. Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.<\/p>\n<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company&#8217;s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling \u2014 enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.<\/p>\n<p>AaaS could come bundled with multiple business-intelligence-related services. Primarily, the service includes (1) services for data warehouses; (2) services for visualizations and reports; and (3) services for predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). When a company partners with an MSP for analytics as a service, organizations are able to tap into business intelligence easily, instantly and at a lower cost of ownership than doing it in-house.

Apple<\/a>, focusing on complaints by Spotify that Apple&#8217;s App Store policies \u2014 particularly its requirements around in-app purchase \u2014 are anti-competitive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The

sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Toponce, a systems administrator at XMission, received a letter on Thursday from a law firm representing What3Words, requesting that he delete tweets related to the open-source alternative, WhatFreeWords. The letter also demands that he disclose to the law firm the identity of the person or people with whom he had shared a copy of the software, agree that he would not make any further copies of the software and to delete any copies of the software he had in his possession.<\/p>\n<p>The letter gave him until May 7 to agree, after which What3Words would &#8220;waive any entitlement it may have to pursue related claims against you,&#8221; a thinly-veiled threat of legal action.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not a battle worth fighting,&#8221; he said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AaronToponce\/status\/1387933438305394690?s=20\">in a tweet<\/a>.

In a later write-up, Tierney said What3Words was <a href=\"https:\/\/cybergibbons.com\/security-2\/why-what3words-is-not-suitable-for-safety-critical-applications\/\">not adequate<\/a> for use in safety-critical cases.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the only downside. Critics have <a href=\"https:\/\/shkspr.mobi\/blog\/2019\/03\/why-bother-with-what-three-words\/ \">long argued<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; proprietary geocoding technology, which it bills as &#8220;life-saving,&#8221; makes it harder to examine it for problems or security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6HwlbIsMT7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/\">Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/embed\/#?secret=6HwlbIsMT7\" data-secret=\"6HwlbIsMT7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Concerns about its lack of openness in part led to the creation of the WhatFreeWords. A copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/justpaste.it\/39hat\">the project&#8217;s website<\/a>, which does not contain the code itself, said the open-source alternative was developed by reverse-engineering What3Words. &#8220;Once we found out how it worked, we coded implementations for it for JavaScript and Go,&#8221; the website said. &#8220;To ensure that we did not violate the What3Words company&#8217;s copyright, we did not include any of their code, and we only included the bare minimum data required for interoperability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But the project&#8217;s website was nevertheless subjected to a <a href=\"https:\/\/ivan.sanchezortega.es\/w3w-bullying\/2019-09-19\/SCIP%20-%20Ecommerce%20Takedown%20Notice%20-%20W3W%2019%20Sept%202019.pdf\">copyright takedown request<\/a> filed by What3Words&#8217; counsel. Even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.owenboswarva.com\/misc\/W3W_Twitter_20191007.pdf\">tweets<\/a> that pointed to cached or backup copies of the code were removed by Twitter at the lawyers&#8217; requests.<\/p>\n<p>Toponce \u2014 a security researcher on the side \u2014 contributed to Tierney&#8217;s research, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1387164574294712321\">tweeting out<\/a> his findings as he went. Toponce said that he offered to share a copy of the WhatFreeWords code with other researchers to help Tierney with his ongoing research into What3Words. Toponce told TechCrunch that receiving the legal threat may have been a combination of offering to share the code and also finding problems with What3Words.<\/p>\n<p>In its letter to Toponce, What3Words argues that WhatFreeWords contains its intellectual property and that the company &#8220;cannot permit the dissemination&#8221; of the software.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, several websites still retain copies of the code and are easily searchable through Google, and TechCrunch has seen several tweets linking to the WhatFreeWords code since Toponce went public with the legal threat. Tierney, who did not use WhatFreeWords as part of his research, said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1388187147560161282\">in a tweet<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; reaction was &#8220;totally unreasonable given the ease with which you can find versions online.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We asked What3Words if the company could point to a case where a judicial court has asserted that WhatFreeWords has violated its copyright. What3Words spokesperson Miriam Frank did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZMXrNbYiy4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/\">Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/embed\/#?secret=ZMXrNbYiy4\" data-secret=\"ZMXrNbYiy4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A U.K. company behind digital addressing system What3Words has sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.

Here&#8217;s a clearer picture of the instance used at the beginning of this piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a VC-backed startup whose ultimate goal is to help scale up female-founded SMEs with one-year loans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The startup could <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easily<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use its equity to provide the capital for all the one-year loans.

market-maker between investors and investment opportunities.

It\u2019s hard enough to get retail investors, but family offices and other large check writers are even more challenging to lure.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been meeting lately with an increasing number of family offices interested in investing directly into companies in lieu of via funds. As a result, I\u2019ve started investigating some of the online platforms that enable direct investing.

As of Q1 2021, the number of fintech startups in the U.S. crossed 10,000 for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/893954\/number-fintech-startups-by-region\/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202021%2C%20there,in%20the%20Asia%20Pacific%20region.\">first time ever<\/a> \u2014 well more than double that if you include EMEA and APAC. There are now three fintech companies worth more than $100 billion (Paypal, Square and Shopify) with another three in the $50 billion-$100 billion club (Stripe, Adyen and Coinbase).<\/p>\n<p>Yet, as fintech companies have begun to go public, there has been a fair amount of uncertainty as to how these companies will be valued on the public markets. This is a result of fintechs being relatively new to the IPO scene compared to their consumer internet or enterprise software counterparts. In addition, fintechs employ a wide variety of business models: Some are transactional, others are recurring or have hybrid business models.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, fintechs now have a multitude of options in terms of how they choose to go public. They can take the traditional IPO route, pursue a direct listing or merge with a SPAC. Given the multitude of variables at play, valuing these companies and then predicting public market performance is anything but straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt is important to note that fintech is a complex category with many different types of players, and not all fintech is created equal.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>The fintech gold rush has arrived<\/h2>\n<p>For much of the past two decades, fintech as a category has been very quiet on the public markets. But that began to change considerably by the mid-2010s. Fintech had clearly arrived by 2015, with both Square and Shopify going public that year. Last year was a record one with eight fintech IPOs, and there has been no slowdown in 2021 \u2014 the first four months have already produced seven IPOs. By our estimates, there are more than 15 additional fintech companies that could IPO this year. The current record will almost certainly be shattered well before the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2145901\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2145901\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2145901 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?w=680\" alt=\"Fintech IPOs from 2000 to 2021\" width=\"680\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png 1358w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?resize=300,159 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?resize=768,406 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?resize=680,360 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image1.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2145901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><b>Image Credits: <\/b> Oak HC\/FT<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether it be via SPAC, direct listing or traditional IPO, we are likely to see at least 10 to 15 fintechs go public this year \u2014 possibly more.

2017 that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/articles\/columns\/hip-hop\/7710322\/jay-z-roc-nation-arrive-start-up-platform\">forming a venture investment arm<\/a> called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/showcase\/arrivevc\/\">Arrive<\/a>. And the firm has been busy since then \u2014 co-founder and president Neil Sirni said Arrive has made 29 investments thus far.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Sirni hasn&#8217;t really said much about those investments publicly, or about the broader strategy. So he reached out to me a few months ago, suggesting that he was ready to provide more details about Arrive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re now three years, 29 investments in and expanding &#8212; so it felt like the right time to start opening up a bit,&#8221; he said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Over the course of a few back-and-forth emails, we discussed how Arrive fits into the larger aims of Roc Nation, how Sirni (a former Goldman Sachs executive) makes investment decisions and where he&#8217;s focusing next. (Spoiler: Southeast Asia is a big part of that answer.)<\/p>\n<p>He was also eager to provide testimonials from Arrive&#8217;s portfolio companies \u2014 for example, Outlier.org founder Aaron Rasmussen said that &#8220;when Arrive commits to your mission, they commit,&#8221; while Helm co-founder and CEO Giri Sreenivas said that the firm &#8220;brings something that I don\u2019t see in traditional institutional investors &#8212; legitimate operational expertise around brand and marketing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can read our email Q&amp;A, lightly edited for length and style, below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Arrive and how does it fit into the larger Roc Nation umbrella?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arrive is Roc Nation\u2019s venture platform. Roc Nation is a full-service music and sports management, music publishing and entertainment company founded by Jay-Z. Roc Nation and its affiliated companies have built a diversified business that employs several hundred people. These businesses include artist and athlete representation, a portfolio of spirit brands, an apparel line, a philanthropy division that manages four charitable organizations, a content streaming service, a digital team that oversees social media accounts with over 1.4 billion followers, a sales and marketing division that works on countless partnerships with Fortune 500 companies, communications, video production and live event production, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The Roc Nation infrastructure can add value to many different types of businesses across various stages, which is why we created Arrive. For consumer-facing businesses, Arrive leverages the Roc Nation infrastructure to help companies with branding, creative, marketing, communications and other services. For enterprise, we use our broad network of B2B relationships to help with business development.<\/p>\n<p>Being a strategic venture investor on the cap table of a portfolio company is not only about the investment but also how much human capital a fund can deploy to drive long-term, real and unique value for entrepreneurs and their businesses. So, we\u2019re leveraging the broader Roc Nation platform to help portfolio companies and, in turn, receiving access to great entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fYRexTCV6W\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/outlier-series-b\/\">MasterClass co-founder&#8217;s Outlier.org raises $30M for affordable, virtual college courses<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;MasterClass co-founder&#8217;s Outlier.org raises $30M for affordable, virtual college courses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/outlier-series-b\/embed\/#?secret=fYRexTCV6W\" data-secret=\"fYRexTCV6W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>What kinds of investments do you normally make \u2014 types of companies, size of investment, etc.?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re relatively sector and stage agnostic. We have dedicated capital in an early-stage fund that tends to focus on Series A to Series C, but we\u2019ve also started SPV growth and pre-IPO investments as we lay the foundation for a dedicated growth vehicle later this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you make investment decisions? Is Jay-Z involved in the process?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We gravitate toward companies that we can provide meaningful assistance to but that are outside of Roc Nation\u2019s core industries of music and traditional sports. Thanks to our platform, that is an extremely broad opportunity set. To date, we\u2019ve made 29 investments under the Arrive umbrella in everything from fintech, insurtech, edtech, health &amp; wellness, social and gaming. Geographically, we\u2019re investing roughly 80% in North America, primarily the U.S., and 20% across Southeast Asia, namely, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. As a strategic investor, we never lead deals and always co-invest.<\/p>\n<p>Our long-term focus is on driving real and unique value for our portfolio companies. If we remain hyper-focused on this mission, we believe we have the opportunity to build an enduring brand as a top-tier strategic investor.<\/p>\n<p>Jay-Z approves every Arrive opportunity; he, Juan Perez and Desiree Perez are overwhelmingly supportive of Arrive and what we\u2019re collectively trying to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your biggest success story so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m very proud of being co-founder of Arrive and what it took to get here. In the grand scheme of things, we\u2019re just getting started, but I\u2019ve been an entrepreneur \u2014 after leaving a large public company \u2014 for over 10 years now. It\u2019s been a roller coaster with many sacrifices, but I can understand and relate to our founders and their journey, which makes this experience even more rewarding. The founders of Roc Nation have built their businesses brick by brick as well, so the entire organization is united by this entrepreneurial mindset. I still consider myself a founder and operator first, whose business happens to be making investments.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1607815\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1607815\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1607815\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg 2600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/gettyimages-496615428.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1607815\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">NEW YORK, NY &#8211; OCTOBER 20: Jay-Z performs during Tidal X: 1020 at Barclays Center on October 20, 2015 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill\/FilmMagic)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Given that Arrive has been around for a few years, what made you feel like this is the time to start talking more openly about the fund?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When Arrive launched a few years ago, I hated the idea of talking about what we\u2019re going to do. Instead, we wanted to quietly actually go do it; learn, improve, build and, in the process, demonstrate that we\u2019re not, and never will be, tourists in the venture ecosystem. We\u2019re now three years, 29 investments in and expanding &#8212; so it felt like the right time to start opening up a bit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s an example of an investment where working with Arrive\/Roc Nation led to gains beyond the financial investment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arrive functions like many other investors in that we spend time understanding a company\u2019s vision and then try to provide them meaningful levers to pull to help drive their success. Our toolkit is unique thanks to the Roc Nation platform and network. We\u2019ve found that both our portfolio companies and their other investors, typically traditional venture funds, find those levers complementary and additive to the cap table.<\/p>\n<p>Arrive typically works with portfolio companies across three main areas. The first is creative and brand marketing. The second is business development and partnerships. The third is communications.<\/p>\n<p>Communications efforts are generally focused on driving short-term or immediate awareness. Many of our portfolio companies receive broader press coverage when we invest in them. That initial attention typically dies down within a week or two, although those news stories remain as searchable assets that the company might not otherwise have. While this can be of some value, especially for consumer businesses, we believe it\u2019s at the bottom of the list compared to the long-term benefits that can be derived from Roc Nation\u2019s underlying infrastructure in brand marketing and business development.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of creative and brand marketing, we\u2019ve likely saved our earlier-stage portfolio, in aggregate, over a million dollars by providing brand and agency work at no cost. Examples of this include campaign ideation, graphic design, video production, hosting live events and product integrations, among other activities.<\/p>\n<p>For business development and partnerships support, we have leveraged our network to help portfolio companies launch their own internal philanthropic platforms, leveraged our B2B relationships to introduce new partners and customers, brought in other strategic investors in a targeted way, helped companies navigate endorsement deals and recruited non-technical executive talent to join their companies.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t pretend to be a magic bullet, no investor can be, but we\u2019re focused on continuously improving and building on the services that we provide to our portfolio companies. The founder journey is never a straight line and we pride ourselves on being willing to do whatever we can on their behalf. Stephen Francis, SVP at Arrive, and I are accessible to our portfolio companies any day and time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aZ3LkFdOP7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021\/\">10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=aZ3LkFdOP7\" data-secret=\"aZ3LkFdOP7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Do you see these investments as primarily strategic for Roc Nation, or are you focused on financial returns?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2018Strategic\u2019 investor, in the context of Arrive, refers to the strategic value that we bring to the cap table of a portfolio company. We leverage that strategic value to get into deals and form relationships with entrepreneurs in whom we have high conviction. Our ultimate goal is financial return and Arrive\u2019s investments are not meant to be strategic in nature for Roc Nation as an operating company. Instead, an investment from Arrive is meant to be strategic for the portfolio company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You said you&#8217;re stage agnostic with capital devoted to different stages. Can you say anything more about what the breakdown is in terms of early-stage versus later-growth deals, and how that might change with the new growth fund?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of our 29 investments, I would classify 25 as early-stage and four as growth. In regards to percentage of capital, the four growth investments account for a little over 35% of total capital deployed. When we do have a dedicated growth fund, I expect the volume of growth investments to pick up to roughly three-six per year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0What are your priorities for 2021?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At a high level our priorities are to build out a larger team to ensure that we\u2019re staying very engaged with the portfolio as we scale and to continue being aggressive in deploying more capital to back great companies.<\/p>\n<p>On a more granular level I\u2019m looking forward to physically getting back to Southeast Asia, namely Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam, on a regular basis. We\u2019re really bullish on the region and believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before more venture funds deploy significant capital there. We started to invest a lot of time there in 2019 as part of our plan to deploy roughly 30% of our early-stage fund in the region. That expansion has been hindered by COVID-19. However, I\u2019ll make quarterly trips once travel normalizes. There is nothing like in-person interaction to build relationships and trust, especially internationally.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vwxTZI77Lg\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020\/\">How VCs invested in Asia and Europe in 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How VCs invested in Asia and Europe in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020\/embed\/#?secret=vwxTZI77Lg\" data-secret=\"vwxTZI77Lg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jay-Z&#8217;s Roc Nation announced in 2017 that it was forming a venture investment arm called Arrive.

href=\"https:\/\/www.uiflow.com\/\">Uiflow<\/a>, a startup that is building a no-code enterprise app creation service.<\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking\u00a0<em>wait, don&#8217;t a number of companies already do that?<\/em>, the answer is yes. But what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quickbase.com\/\">Quickbase<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartsheet.com\/\">Smartsheet<\/a> and others are working on isn&#8217;t quite the same thing, at least from the startup&#8217;s perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Uiflow, a Bay Area-based concern that has been alive for far less than a year, has built an app creation tool that works with whatever backend a large company currently employs, and helps its development team build apps collaboratively. As the startup explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/uiflow-studio\">a public posting<\/a>, customer developers can import Figma files while their engineers can use existing UI libraries, and product managers can quickly vet an app&#8217;s logic.<\/p>\n<p>The service is akin to a &#8220;cross between Unity and Figma,&#8221; Uiflow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ycombinator.com\/companies\/uiflow\">says<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what its own user interface looks like, per a screenshot the company provided to TechCrunch after an interview:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2146281\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-42.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Per Y Combinator, the company has closed a pre-seed round of more than $500,000. The company told TechCrunch that it has been talking to investors lately &#8212; as essentially every Y Combinator-backed startup does after their public unveiling &#8212;\u00a0 but appears to be holding off raising more capital until it fully launches self-service of its product; the company may also accelerate its hiring efforts once its self-serve GTM motion is more broadly available.<\/p>\n<p>The startup told TechCrunch that after its Product Hunt <a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/uiflow-studio\">launch<\/a> it picked up around 1,200 signups. It&#8217;s vetting the group and letting in some as pilot customers. Those customers currently pay the company, so it has revenue, although the startup is more product-focused at the moment than centered around boosting its short-term revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Uiflow thinks that its target customers are companies with 250 or more workers, the scale at which a company begins to start thinking about its own UI elements. However, Uiflow is talking to companies with 100 to 1,000 customers, it said.<\/p>\n<p>The five-person team is building a service in a market that is more than active at the moment. As TechCrunch has explored, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/22\/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries\/\">private-market investors are bullish on the no-code space<\/a>, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic bolstered the pace at which companies large and small moved toward digital solutions. No-code and low-code services came into greater demand as accelerating digital transformation efforts met the market&#8217;s general dearth of available developer talent.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has covered the no-code space <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks\/\">extensively in recent quarters<\/a>, given both rising market demand for its products and what seemed to be growing investor demand for shares in startups pursuing the model. All that&#8217;s to say that there&#8217;s a reasonable chance that we&#8217;ll hear from Uiflow soon regarding a fresh capital raise. Let&#8217;s see how long that takes.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, here&#8217;s a photo of the Uiflow team.

Games updates its privacy notice to start developing voice comms moderation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Anyone who has played a video game with voice chat in the past decade knows that there is some risk involved. You might be greeted by friendly teammates, but you may also hear some of the most toxic language you&#8217;ve ever heard in your life.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.riotgames.com\/en\">Riot Games<\/a>, the game developer behind ultra popular titles like League of Legends and Valorant, is thinking hard about this. And taking action.<\/p>\n<p>The developer is today announcing changes to its privacy notice that allow for it to capture and evaluate voice comms when a report is submitted around disruptive behavior. The changes to the policy are Riot-wide, meaning that all players across all games will need to accept those changes. However, the only game that is scheduled to utilize these new abilities is Valorant, as it is the most voice chat-heavy game from Riot.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The plan here is to store relevant audio data in the account&#8217;s registered region and evaluate it to see if the behavior agreement was violated. This process is triggered by a report being submitted, and is not an always-on system. If a violation has occurred, the data will be made available to the player in violation and will ultimately be deleted once there is no further need for it following reviews. If no violation is detected, the data will be deleted.<\/p>\n<p>Before we go any further, let me just say that this is a big fucking deal. Publishers and developers have long known that toxicity in gaming is not only a terrible user experience, but it&#8217;s actively preventing large swaths of potential gamers from dedicating themselves to it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Players are experiencing a lot of pain in voice comms and that pain takes the form of all kinds of different disruption in behavior and it can be pretty harmful,&#8221; said Head of Players Dynamics Weszt Hart. &#8220;We recognize that, and we have made a promise to players that we will do everything that we could in this space.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Voice chat often makes games much richer and more fun. Particularly during the pandemic, people are craving more human connection. But in a tense environment like competitive games, that connection can turn sour.<\/p>\n<p>As a gamer myself, I can safely say that some of the most hurtful experiences of my life have been while playing video games with strangers.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, Riot isn&#8217;t getting specific with how exactly this voice chat moderation will work. The first step is the update to its privacy notice, which gives players a heads up and gives the company the right to start evaluating voice comms.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s incredibly difficult to police voice comms. Not only do you need to be transparent with users and update any legal documents (which is arguably the easiest step, and the one Riot is taking today), but you must develop the right technology to do this, all while protecting player privacy.<\/p>\n<p>I spoke with Hart and Data Protection Officer and CISO Chris Hymes about the changes. The duo said that the actual system for detecting behavior violations within voice comms is still under development. It may focus on automated voice-to-text transcription, and go through the same system as text chat moderation, or it may rely more heavily on machine learning to actually detect an infringement via voice alone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at the technologies and we&#8217;re trying to land on the one that we want to launch with,&#8221; said Hart. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been putting a lot of time and effort into space and we have a pretty good idea of the direction that we&#8217;re going to take. But what we want to do is to have some audio to work with, to better understand if any other approaches that we&#8217;re looking at are going to be the best. To do this, we need to be able to process something real, and not just make a good guess.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To get to that answer as quickly as possible, he added, the first step of updating the privacy notice had to go into effect.<\/p>\n<p>Hart and Hymes also said that some layer of human moderation will be involved to ensure that whatever system is being developed is working properly and can ultimately be rolled out to other languages and other titles, as the system is initially being developed for Valorant in North America.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8XRwRxUkxE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/vcs-discuss-gamings-biggest-infrastructure-investment-opportunities-in-2021\/\">VCs discuss gaming&#8217;s biggest infrastructure investment opportunities in 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;VCs discuss gaming&#8217;s biggest infrastructure investment opportunities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/vcs-discuss-gamings-biggest-infrastructure-investment-opportunities-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=8XRwRxUkxE\" data-secret=\"8XRwRxUkxE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Advances in machine learning and natural language processing are making that development easier than it was 10, or even two, years ago. But even in a world where a machine learning algorithm could accurately detect hate speech, with all its nuances, there is yet another hurdle.<\/p>\n<p>Gamers, even from one title to the next, have their own language. There is a whole lexicon of words and terms used by gamers that aren&#8217;t used in every day life. This adds yet another complication to the process of developing this system.<\/p>\n<p>Still, this is a critical step in ensuring that Riot Games titles, and hopefully other titles as well, become an inclusive environment where anyone who wants to game feels safe and able to do so.<\/p>\n<p>And Riot is careful to understand that developing games is a holistic endeavor.

Mike Vernal will share how to iterate with tempo at TC Early Stage in July"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2\/?promo=sequoiapost\">TC Early Stage<\/a> is back in July and we have a fantastic lineup in store that&#8217;s laser-focused on marketing and fundraising. That includes, but is not limited to, Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal, whose portfolio companies include Citizen, PicsArt, Whisper, Threads, Houseparty and more.<\/p>\n<p>Vernal will be leading a discussion on tempo and product-market fit. The chat stems from Vernal&#8217;s experience as an investor, sharing the lesser-known keys to success to not only secure early investment, but to use it to secure a later-stage investment.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, tempo is everything. At the earliest stage, investors are looking more at the team than the product, knowing that the likelihood of the product changing and evolving is high. That means that the ability to adapt \u2014 including the systems in place to collect feedback and willingness to continue iterating \u2014 are incredibly important factors.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Vernal will not only stress the importance of tempo and product iteration (and how it relates to fundraising success), he&#8217;ll also share how both enterprise and consumer companies should go about creating these feedback loops with customers and how to iterate quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Vernal joined Sequoia as a partner in 2016. He currently sits on the boards of Citizen, Jumpstart, rideOS, PicsArt, Rockset, Threads and Whisper. Before Sequoia, Mike was VP at Facebook, where he led a variety of product and engineering teams.

raises $1.38M to remove the barriers of trademark registration for small businesses"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Platforms like Shopify, Stripe and WordPress have done a lot to make essential business-building tools &#8212; like running storefronts, accepting payments and building websites &#8212; accessible to businesses with even the most modest budgets. But some very key aspects of setting up a company remain expensive, time-consuming affairs that can be cost-prohibitive for small businesses \u2014 but that, if ignored, can result in the failure of a business before it even really gets started.<\/p>\n<p>Trademark registration is one such concern, and Toronto-based startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heirlumeco.com\/\">Heirlume<\/a> just raised $1.7 million CAD (~$1.38 million) to address the problem with a machine-powered trademark registration platform that turns the process into a self-serve affair that won&#8217;t break the budget. Its AI-based trademark search will flag if terms might run afoul of existing trademarks in the U.S. and Canada, even when official government trademark search tools, and even top-tier legal firms, might not.<\/p>\n<p>Heirlume&#8217;s core focus is on leveling the playing field for small business owners, who have typically been significantly out-matched when it comes to any trademark conflicts.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a senior-level IP lawyer focused in trademarks, and had practiced in a traditional model, boutique firm of my own for over a decade serving big clients, and small clients,&#8221; explained Heirlume co-founder Julie MacDonell in an interview. &#8220;So providing big multinationals with a lot of brand strategy, and in-house legal, and then mainly serving small business clients when they were dealing with a cease-and-desist, or an infringement issue. It&#8217;s really those clients that have my heart: It&#8217;s incredibly difficult to have a small business owner literally crying tears on the phone with you, because they just lost their brand or their business overnight. And there was nothing I could do to help because the law just simply wasn&#8217;t on their side, because they had neglected to register their trademarks to own them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In part, there&#8217;s a lack of awareness around what it takes to actually register and own a trademark, MacDonell says. Many entrepreneurs just starting out seek out a domain name as a first step, for instance, and some will fork over significant sums to register these domains. What they don&#8217;t realize, however, is that this is essentially a rental, and if you don&#8217;t have the trademark to protect that domain, the actual trademark owner can potentially take it away down the road. But even if business owners do realize that a trademark should be their first stop, the barriers to actually securing one are steep.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There was an an enormous, insurmountable barrier, when it came to brand protection for those business owners,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it just isn&#8217;t fair. Every other business service, generally a small business owner can access. Incorporating a company or even insurance, for example, owning and buying insurance for your business is somewhat affordable and accessible. But brand ownership is not.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Heirlume brings the cost of trademark registration down from many thousands of dollars to just under $600 for the first, and only $200 for each additional after that. The startup is also offering a very small business-friendly &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; option supported by Clearbanc, which means that even businesses starting on a shoestring can take the step of protecting their brand at the outset.<\/p>\n<p>In its early days, Heirlume is also offering its core trademark search feature for free. That provides a trademark search engine that works across both U.S. and Canadian government databases, which can not only tell you if your desired trademark is available or already held, but also reveal whether it&#8217;s likely to be able to be successfully obtained, given other conflicts that might arise that are totally ignored by native trademark database search portals.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146160\" style=\"width: 1553px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146160\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2146160 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Heirlume search tool comparison\" width=\"1543\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg 1543w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=1536,793 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/screenshot-2021-04-30-at-11.05.43-AM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1543px) 100vw, 1543px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146160\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Heirlume<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Heirlume uses machine learning to identify these potential conflicts, which not only helps users searching for their trademarks, but also greatly decreases the workload behind the scenes, helping them lower costs and pass on the benefits of those improved margins to its clients. That&#8217;s how it can achieve better results than even hand-tailored applications from traditional firms, while doing so at scale and at reduced costs.<\/p>\n<p>Another advantage of using machine-powered data processing and filing is that on the government trademark office side, the systems are looking for highly organized, curated data sets that are difficult for even trained people to get consistently right. Human error in just data entry can cause massive backlogs, MacDonell notes, even resulting in entire applications having to be tossed and started over from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are all sorts of data sets for those [trademark requirement] parameters,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Essentially, we synthesize all of that, and the goal through machine learning is to make sure that applications are utterly compliant with government rules. We actually have a senior-level trademark examiner that came to work for us, very excited that we were solving the problems causing backlogs within the government. She said that if Heirlume can get to a point where the applications submitted are perfect, there will be no backlog with the government.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Improving efficiency within the trademark registration bodies means one less point of friction for small business owners when they set out to establish their company, which means more economic activity and upside overall. MacDonell ultimately hopes that Heirlume can help reduce friction to the point where trademark ownership is at the forefront of the business process, even before domain registration. Heirlume has a partnership with Google Domains to that end, which will eventually see indication of whether a domain name is likely to be trademarkable included in Google Domain search results.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PRI69AVIWA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/22\/how-tech-companies-measure-legal\/\">How tech companies measure &#8216;legal&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How tech companies measure &#8216;legal&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/22\/how-tech-companies-measure-legal\/embed\/#?secret=PRI69AVIWA\" data-secret=\"PRI69AVIWA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This initial seed funding includes participation from Backbone Angels, as well as the Future Capital collective, Angels of Many and MaRS IAF, along with angel investors including Daniel Debow, Sid Lee&#8217;s Bertrand Cesvet and more. MacDonell notes that just as their goal was to bring more access and equity to small business owners when it comes to trademark protection, the startup was also very intentional in building its team and its cap table. MacDonell, along with co-founders CTO Sarah Ruest and Dave McDonell, aim to build the largest tech company with a majority female-identifying technology team. Its investor make-up includes 65% female-identifying or underrepresented investors, and MacDonnell says that was a very intentional choice that extended the time of the raise, and even led to turning down interest from some leading Silicon Valley firms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want underrepresented founders to be to be funded, and the best way to ensure that change is to empower underrepresented investors,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think that we all have a responsibility to actually do something. We&#8217;re all using hashtags right now, and hashtags are not enough [&#8230;] Our CTO is female, and she&#8217;s often been the only female person in the room. We&#8217;ve committed to ensuring that women in tech are no longer the only woman in the room.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Platforms like Shopify, Stripe and WordPress have done a lot to make essential business-building tools &#8212; like running storefronts, accepting payments and building websites &#8212; accessible to businesses with even the most modest budgets.
